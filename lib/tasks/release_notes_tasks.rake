We're both pretty burnt out from this slog, so apologies if my trademark Release Note humour misses the mark this time around.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThis release is a pretty fundamental change which address the more abstract concept that is Matrix buying and selling. Initially there was an issue we needed to address, but the truth is there was no quick win on this, so we really had to knuckle down, fire up all cylinders in the old noodle, and go into a proper coding frenzy. We spent a lot of time in the Newbury office*, where we could really thrash out ideas, logic problems, and processes quickly and efficiently.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIn reality, this release is complex and it's difficult to break it down into a list of changes without it becoming a huge document, (plus most of you have been using it for a couple of days already) so I've kept it as simple as possible. I'm also going to leave out all the under-the-hood changes which support the new features, but let's just say this work was done in a way which revolutionises the way we look at, build, and manage TIM from a technical standpoint.\r\n\r\n<br /><small><small>*The Wetherspoons in Newbury.

The dust has started to settle, though, and it seems like we're now in a good place with it (feel free to let us know if not!), so here's a run through of all the love we've given TIM since then, a lot of which was to put out some of the Inventory related fires 🔥🔥<br /><br />\r\nWe also introduced Stath to TIM's team of friendly idiots. He's done a great job of increasing our test coverage, enforcing some professional-level development practices, such as <em>semantic versioning</em>, which is what that thing at the end of this release note's title is.<br />With his help, we're also moving to a more structured release schedule, whereby a new version of TIM will be released on Wednesday every week. Ask your head of department for more information 😀<br />He's also really taken on the horny bull that is housekeeping, removing smelly code (that's legit a technical term) from TIM and helping us understand why it smells.", outro: "There, as usual, are a number of fixes, changes and improvements under the hood which keep the TIM motor purring. Think of it like a decorated room. Yeah, you have pictures on the wall, but the nails they're hanging on are starting to sag, so you pop some rawl plugs and screws in instead, and now they're never going to shift. Which means a lot less of this...<br /><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/oqnKiZVG3dYfC/source.gif\" />", published: true},
